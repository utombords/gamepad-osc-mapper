# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone. We expect all participants to:

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent; seek to understand before disagreeing.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks.
- Use inclusive language.

Unacceptable behavior includes: insulting comments, sexualized language or imagery, deliberate intimidation or stalking, sustained disruption, and any form of discrimination.

## Enforcement
- Report issues to the maintainers via GitHub Issues (or private contact if sensitive).
- Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions not aligned with this code.
- Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent bans from participation.

This is a simplified policy inspired by the Contributor Covenant. We may refine it over time.
